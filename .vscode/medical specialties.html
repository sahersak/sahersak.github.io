                        <h3>Neurology</h3>
                        <p class="text text-sm">neurology is the branch of medicine that deals with disorders of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles. 
                            Neurologists are medical doctors who specialize in diagnosing, treating, and managing conditions that affect the nervous system.
                            Diagnosis: Neurologists use a combination of clinical evaluation, neurological examinations, and diagnostic tests to assess the functioning of the nervous system and diagnose neurological conditions.
                             Diagnostic tests may include imaging studies such as MRI or CT scans, electroencephalography (EEG), nerve conduction studies, and lumbar puncture (spinal tap), among others.

                        <h3>Orthopedic</h3>
                        <p class="text text-sm">Orthopaedics is the broad based medical and surgical specialty dedicated to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system. The frequency and impact of these diseases and injuries combined with recent advances in their diagnosis and treatment make orthopaedics a critical part of health care.

                            All Board Certified orthopaedists are trained surgeons.
                             Some may no longer perform surgery, but still treat patients.
                             Other orthopaedic surgeons may hold research, teaching, or administrative positions and may or may not see patients.

                        <h3>Pulmonologist</h3>
                        <p class="text text-sm">A pulmonologist is a physician who specializes in the respiratory system. From the windpipe to the lungs, if your complaint involves the lungs or any part of the respiratory system, a pulmonologist is the doc you want to solve the problem.

                            Pulmonology is a medical field of study within internal medicine. These doctors go through the same training as an internist. They receive their degree, complete an internal medicine residency, then several years as a fellow focused primarily on pulmonology and often includes critical care and sleep medicine. After that, they have to take and pass specialty exams, and only then are they able to take patients as a Board-Certified pulmonologist.
